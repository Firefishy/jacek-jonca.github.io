PowerPoint was first released in 1987
While over the last 30 years computing grew by an unimaginable exponent, internet grew by x users, and bandwith increases we still present as if it was 1987.
Presentations are mainly sequential, not easily portable, and lacking ability to adapt across screen sizes, devices, and platforms.
Those presentations do not reflect how brain processes informationa and ignore evolutionary history
Telling stories never gets old. Our brains have an embedded need for narrative, whether itâ€™s schemas, scripts, cognitive maps, mental models or metaphors. In many ways, stories are how we think and make sense of the world around us, and this extends to business concepts as well.
Yet up to date there are no convenient tools that would help harness power of stories in presentations.
