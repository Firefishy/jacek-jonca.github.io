Alright guys I'm here with a man that

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.589
needs no introduction Mr. Warren Buffett

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.350
and the question I have is Warren what

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.880
is one tip, so you're talking to people

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.240
that are 21, 22 just graduating school.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.670
What is one tip that you can give them?

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.680
any realm of light? BUFFETT: It's very simple

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.270
invest in yourself and the one easy way

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.330
to become worth 50% more than you are

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.160
now at least there is to hone your

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.539
communication skills both written and verbal.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.870
I mean, aaaaa you can but you can't communicate you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.280
know it's like waiting and the girl in

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.320
the dark nobody happened but so you got

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.820
so you have all the brainpower in the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.230
world but you gotta get to transmit it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.000
then. The transmission is communication.
